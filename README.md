# PartInspector

This is a mod for My Summer Car that lets you look at car parts to see how damaged they are. For more info, take a look at the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/2291).

Feel free to use the code here for learning or reference; everything is very documented, although I still need to update the accessors to be more clean. [dnSpyEx](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy) is a resource I made extensive use of when making this mod, and might be handy for you if you want to see how the code changes in compilation.

I used the following resources to help make and test this mod:
- [dnSpyEx](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy) is a very useful tool for peeking how some of the code works internally, as well as seeing how your code changes in compilation.
- [BetterCheatBox](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/1679) helped a lot in testing things to make sure they worked on fresh saves.
- [Developer Toolkit](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/developer-toolkit.17214/) is, as far as I can tell, the only functional mod for modern versions of the game that can be used to the logic of the FSMs that My Summer Car largely runs on. If you want to do any kind of modding, you'll want this or something like it. It's possible that [Developer Toolset II](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/345) might work if you use the MSCLoader compatibility tool, but I haven't tried it.
- Honorable mention goes to [Modern Optimization Plugin/MOP](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/146), which is by and large the only reason I can play MSC in the first place without wanting to claw my eyes out.
