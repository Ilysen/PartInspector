# PartInspector

This is a mod for My Summer Car that lets you look at car parts to see how damaged they are. For more info, take a look at the [Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/2291).

Feel free to use the code here for learning or reference; everything is very documented, although I still need to update the accessors to be more clean. [dnSpyEx](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy) is a resource I made extensive use of when making this mod, and might be handy for you if you want to see how the code changes in compilation.
